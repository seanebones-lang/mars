## Technical Highlights

### 1. Intelligent Consensus

**Weighted Voting** (Recommended):
```python
effective_weight = model_weight * confidence
hallucination_score = weighted_sum / total_weight
```

**Cascading** (Cost-Optimized):
```python
for model in sorted_by_cost:
    if confidence > 0.95:
        break  # Early stopping
```

### 2. Model Configuration

Pre-configured with optimal weights:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: 1.2x (highest accuracy)
- GPT-4 Turbo: 1.1x
- Gemini 2.0 Pro: 1.0x
- Llama 3.1 70B: 0.9x
- Grok 3: 1.0x
- Mistral Large 2: 0.95x

### 3. Performance Tracking

Real-time stats for each model:
- Total calls
- Success rate
- Average latency
- Average confidence
- Total cost

---
