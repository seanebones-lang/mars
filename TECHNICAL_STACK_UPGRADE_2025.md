// Authentication endpoint protection
(http.request.uri.path eq "/api/v1/auth/login") and (rate(1m) > 5)

// Webhook endpoint protection
(http.request.uri.path contains "/webhooks/") and (rate(1m) > 30)
```

##### 4. Malicious Upload Detection
**New Feature**: Scan uploaded files for malware

```javascript
// Enable for file upload endpoints
(http.request.uri.path eq "/api/v1/upload") and (cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_content)
```
