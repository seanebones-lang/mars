## In-Progress Tasks ðŸ”„

### 2. Model Control Plane (MCP) Gateway Integration (mcp-001) - IN PROGRESS
**Effort**: Low | **Impact**: High | **Revenue**: 20-30% referral revenue

**Objective**: Integrate Enkrypt AI-style MCP scanners/registry for real-time interventions including prompt injection, tool poisoning, and bias mitigation.

**Planned Implementation**:
1. Research Enkrypt AI's MCP architecture and API specifications
2. Design integration layer for AgentGuard backend
3. Implement MCP scanner endpoints:
   - `/mcp/scan-prompt` - Prompt injection detection
   - `/mcp/scan-tool` - Tool poisoning detection
   - `/mcp/scan-bias` - Bias mitigation analysis
4. Add MCP registry for tracking scanned requests
5. Create partnership proposal for Enkrypt co-branding
6. Implement revenue sharing tracking system

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Real-time guardrails for prompt injection (3-4 orders of magnitude risk reduction)
- Co-branded enterprise tier with 20-30% referral revenue
- Competitive differentiation through Gartner Cool Vendor partnership
- Enhanced security posture for enterprise customers

**Next Steps**:
- Complete MCP API integration
- Test with sample malicious prompts
- Prepare partnership outreach materials

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **Partnership Timing**: Enkrypt AI partnership negotiations may extend beyond Sprint 1
   - **Mitigation**: Proceed with MCP integration independently, partnership as enhancement
   
2. **Resource Allocation**: Single developer working across multiple low-effort tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize revenue-generating features (MCP, funding) over community features

3. **Technical Dependencies**: Some features require external API integrations
   - **Mitigation**: Design with fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation

### Opportunities
1. **First-Mover Advantage**: MCP integration positions us ahead of competitors
2. **Investor Timing**: Q4 2025 funding environment favorable for AI safety
3. **Community Building**: Model hosting platform can accelerate ecosystem growth

## Next Sprint Preview (Sprint 2: Security & Compliance)

**Focus**: Enterprise security requirements, regulatory compliance  
**Duration**: Weeks 5-8  
**Key Deliverables**:
1. Prompt injection detection endpoint (`security-001`)
2. PII leakage protection (`security-002`)
3. Ethical AI scoring (`ethics-001`)
4. Cybersecurity threat detection (`cyber-001`)
5. Compliance agent mapping (`compliance-001`)

**Expected Impact**: Enterprise-ready security posture, regulatory compliance foundation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1.  Complete infrastructure documentation (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Finalize MCP gateway integration and testing
3.  Initiate Enkrypt AI partnership outreach
4.  Begin investor pitch deck preparation (parallel track)

### Sprint Optimization
1. **Parallelize Low-Effort Tasks**: Assign parental controls and streaming to separate development tracks
2. **Front-load Revenue Features**: Prioritize MCP and funding over community features
3. **Establish Partnerships Early**: Begin Enkrypt discussions now for Q1 2026 launch

### Resource Needs
- **Development**: 1 senior engineer (current allocation sufficient)
- **Business Development**: 0.5 FTE for partnership and investor outreach
- **Technical Writing**: 0.25 FTE for pitch deck and partnership materials
