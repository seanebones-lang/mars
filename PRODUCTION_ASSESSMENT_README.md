# Production Readiness Assessment

**Mothership AI - AgentGuard**  
**Product:** watcher.mothership-ai.com

---

## Overview

This directory contains tools to perform a comprehensive production readiness assessment of the AgentGuard system using Claude AI.

## Files

- **`PRODUCTION_READINESS_INPUT.md`** - Complete system description and current state
- **`run_production_assessment.py`** - Python script to run the assessment
- **`PRODUCTION_ASSESSMENT_README.md`** - This file

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed
2. **Anthropic API key** (Claude)
3. **anthropic** Python package

## Installation

```bash
# Install the Anthropic SDK
pip install anthropic
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Set Your API Key

```bash
export CLAUDE_API_KEY='your-claude-api-key-here'
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:
```bash
echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here" >> .env
source .env
```

### Step 2: Run the Assessment

```bash
python run_production_assessment.py
```

### Step 3: Review Results

The script will generate a file named:
```
PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
```

This file will contain:
- Systematic assessment of all system components
- Identified gaps and issues (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium)
- Comprehensive production readiness plan
- Specific, actionable recommendations

## What the Assessment Covers

### System Components Evaluated
- 12 major features
- 97 REST endpoints
- Backend API (FastAPI/Python)
- Frontend UI (Next.js/React)
- 2 SDKs (Python, JavaScript)
- Database layer
- Caching layer
- External API integrations

### Production Dimensions Assessed
1. Code quality and testing coverage
2. Security vulnerabilities and hardening
3. Performance optimization and scalability
4. Monitoring, logging, and observability
5. Error handling and fault tolerance
6. Infrastructure and deployment configuration
7. Data integrity and backup strategies
8. Compliance and documentation
9. Client-facing interfaces and user experience
10. Operational procedures and incident response

### Priority Levels
- **P0-Critical**: Must be completed before production launch
- **P1-High**: Should be completed within first month of production
- **P2-Medium**: Should be completed within first quarter of production

## Expected Output

The assessment will provide:

1. **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Blocking problems requiring immediate resolution
2. **SECURITY HARDENING** - All security measures and vulnerability mitigations
3. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION** - Scalability and efficiency improvements
4. **MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY** - Complete system visibility
5. **TESTING STRATEGY** - Comprehensive testing approach
6. **DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE** - Production-grade CI/CD
7. **OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES** - Incident response and maintenance
8. **COMPLIANCE & DOCUMENTATION** - Regulatory compliance and docs
9. **CLIENT READINESS** - User-facing features and support

## Timeline Context

- **Investment Deadline**: November 30, 2025
- **Hard Launch**: January 1, 2026
- **Time Remaining**: ~2 months
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

## Cost Estimate

Each assessment run costs approximately:
- Input tokens: ~15,000 tokens (~$0.45)
- Output tokens: ~15,000 tokens (~$2.25)
- **Total**: ~$2.70 per assessment

## Tips

1. **Review the input document first**: Check `PRODUCTION_READINESS_INPUT.md` to ensure all current state information is accurate
2. **Update as needed**: If system state changes, update the input document before running
3. **Run periodically**: Re-run assessment after major changes or milestones
4. **Track progress**: Use assessment output to create actionable tickets/tasks
5. **Prioritize P0 items**: Focus on critical issues first

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable not set"
```bash
export CLAUDE_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

### Error: "No module named 'anthropic'"
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Error: "File not found: PRODUCTION_READINESS_INPUT.md"
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /Users/seanmcdonnell/jupiter/mars
```

## Next Steps After Assessment

1. **Review the generated report** thoroughly
2. **Create GitHub issues** for each P0 and P1 item
3. **Assign priorities** and owners
4. **Create implementation timeline**
5. **Track progress** against production launch date
6. **Re-run assessment** after major improvements
