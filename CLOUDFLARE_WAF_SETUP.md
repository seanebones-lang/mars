## Step 3: Update Nameservers

1. Cloudflare will provide two nameservers (e.g., `ns1.cloudflare.com`, `ns2.cloudflare.com`)
2. Go to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
3. Update nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

**Verification**:
```bash
dig NS mothership-ai.com
# Should show Cloudflare nameservers
```

---

## Step 4: Configure DNS Records

1. In Cloudflare dashboard, go to DNS tab
2. Add DNS records for AgentGuard:

```
Type    Name                Value                           Proxy Status
A       @                   <main-website-ip>              Proxied
CNAME   watcher             agentguard-api.onrender.com    Proxied
CNAME   www                 mothership-ai.com              Proxied
```

**Important**: Enable "Proxied" (orange cloud) to route traffic through Cloudflare WAF

   - **Bot Analytics**: Track bot activity

---

## Step 14: Test WAF Configuration

### Test 1: SQL Injection Protection
```bash
# Should be blocked by WAF
curl "https://watcher.mothership-ai.com/api?id=1' OR '1'='1"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden or Cloudflare challenge page
```

### Test 2: XSS Protection
```bash
# Should be blocked by WAF
curl "https://watcher.mothership-ai.com/api?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

### Test 3: Rate Limiting
```bash
# Should be rate limited after 1000 requests
for i in {1..1100}; do
  curl https://watcher.mothership-ai.com/health
done

# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after 1000 requests
```

### Test 4: DDoS Protection
```bash
# Simulate high traffic (use load testing tool)
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py \
  --headless \
  --users 10000 \
  --spawn-rate 1000 \
  --run-time 1m \
  --host=https://watcher.mothership-ai.com

# Cloudflare should automatically mitigate
```

### Test 5: SSL/TLS
```bash
# Check SSL configuration
curl -I https://watcher.mothership-ai.com

# Should see:
# - HTTP/2 200
# - strict-transport-security header
# - Valid SSL certificate
```

---

## Step 15: Monitor and Tune

### Daily Monitoring
1. Check Security → Analytics for threats
2. Review blocked requests
3. Adjust rules if false positives

### Weekly Review
1. Analyze traffic patterns
2. Update rate limits if needed
3. Review firewall rule effectiveness

### Monthly Audit
1. Review all WAF rules
2. Update OWASP ruleset
3. Test all protection mechanisms

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Legitimate Traffic Blocked

**Symptoms**: Users report 403 errors

**Solution**:
1. Go to Security → Overview
2. Check "Activity Log" for blocked requests
3. Identify the rule blocking legitimate traffic
4. Add exception or adjust rule sensitivity

### Issue: False Positives in Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: Users hit rate limits too quickly

**Solution**:
1. Go to Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules
2. Increase rate limit threshold
3. Or add exception for specific IPs/paths

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Slow response times

**Solution**:
1. Check if WAF rules are too aggressive
2. Disable "Challenge" actions temporarily
3. Use "Log" mode to test rules before enforcing

    """Check if request is coming through Cloudflare."""
    return "CF-Ray" in request.headers

@app.middleware("http")
async def cloudflare_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    """Handle Cloudflare-specific headers."""
    if is_cloudflare_request(request):
        # Get real IP from Cloudflare header
        real_ip = request.headers.get("CF-Connecting-IP")
        if real_ip:
            request.state.client_ip = real_ip
    
    response = await call_next(request)
    return response
