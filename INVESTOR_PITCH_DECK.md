## Slide 2: The Problem

### AI Agents Are Everywhere, But They're Not Safe

**The AI Agent Explosion**:
- 80% of enterprises deploying AI agents by 2026
- $500B+ AI agent market by 2030
- But 48% hallucination rate in reasoning models (2025)

**Critical Safety Gaps**:
- ❌ **Hallucinations**: AI agents generate false information 33-48% of the time
- ❌ **Security Risks**: Prompt injection, tool poisoning, data leakage
- ❌ **Compliance**: EU AI Act, COPPA, FERPA violations
- ❌ **Bias & Harm**: Undetected bias, harmful content, self-harm risks

**The Cost of Failure**:
- $10M+ average cost of AI safety incident
- Regulatory fines up to 6% of global revenue (EU AI Act)
- Reputational damage and customer churn
- Legal liability and lawsuits
