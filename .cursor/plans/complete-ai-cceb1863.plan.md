# Complete AI Agent Safety Platform Implementation

## Phase 1: Repository Consolidation & Infrastructure (Priority: Critical)

### Fix Git Repository Structure
- **Problem**: Frontend and backend are in separate repos causing sync issues
- **Solution**: Consolidate into monorepo with Turborepo/Nx for build orchestration
- **Actions**:
  - Merge `watcher-ai-frontend` repo contents into main `mars` repo
  - Implement Turborepo for dependency graphs and unified CI/CD with caching
  - Configure Vercel workspace configs for `agentguard-ui/` subdirectory
  - Set up GitHub CODEOWNERS for cross-team conflict prevention
  - Implement trunk-based development with GitHub Actions and feature flags

### Infrastructure Setup (Updated for October 2025)
- **Deploy Production Environment**: Render with auto-scaling + edge computing for <100ms latency
- **Database Stack**: 
  - PostgreSQL with row-level security for multi-tenant isolation
  - Redis 8.x with AI extensions for vector search and caching
  - Neo4j 6.x with new query optimizations for graph data
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (cost-efficient) + OpenTelemetry profiling
- **Security**: Zero-trust access with Okta, OWASP AI-specific vulnerability protection, immutable audit logs

## Phase 2: Backend API Completion (Priority: Critical)

### Missing Core Endpoints
Based on frontend expectations, implement these critical endpoints:

#### Workstation Management APIs
```python
# src/api/workstation_endpoints.py
@app.get("/workstations")
@app.get("/workstations/{workstation_id}")
@app.post("/workstations/{workstation_id}/insights")  # Claude-powered analysis
@app.get("/workstations/discovery/ranges")
@app.post("/workstations/discovery/start")
```

#### Analytics & Insights APIs
```python
# src/api/analytics_endpoints.py
@app.get("/analytics/insights")  # Claude business intelligence
@app.get("/analytics/trends/predictions")  # Claude trend analysis
@app.get("/analytics/fleet/insights")  # Fleet-level Claude analysis
```

#### Enhanced Chat & Claude Integration
```python
# src/api/claude_endpoints.py
@app.post("/chat/insights")  # Structured Claude responses
@app.post("/chat/workstation-analysis")
@app.post("/chat/fleet-analysis")
```

### Advanced Detection Capabilities
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Implement GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 integration alongside Claude
- **Self-Consistency Sampling**: 10 generations per model for higher accuracy
- **Statistical Enhancement**: Advanced attention mechanisms and entropy analysis
- **RAG Integration**: Wikipedia grounding and historical data context

## Phase 3: Enterprise Features Implementation (Priority: High)

### Security & Compliance
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication, RBAC, JWT tokens
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for SOC2/HIPAA compliance
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance, data encryption, retention policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting with tenant-based quotas

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
```python
# src/services/tenant_service.py
class TenantService:
    - Tenant isolation and resource management
    - Usage-based billing integration
    - Custom rule engines per tenant
    - Compliance framework configuration
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Real-time agent monitoring and alerts
- **Performance Metrics**: Sub-100ms latency tracking and optimization
- **Escalation System**: Automated alert escalation with on-call scheduling
- **Health Dashboards**: System health monitoring with predictive analytics

## Phase 4: Advanced AI Capabilities (Priority: High)

### Enhanced Detection Accuracy (Target: 99%+)
- **Advanced Ensemble Judge**: Multi-model consensus with dynamic routing
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: UQLM integration for confidence scoring
- **Tree of Thought Reasoning**: Complex query analysis
- **Attention-Based Weighting**: Statistical model improvements

### Industry-Specific Detection
```python
# src/services/custom_rules_engine.py
class CustomRulesEngine:
    - Healthcare: Medical misinformation detection
    - Finance: Investment fraud detection  
    - Legal: Regulatory compliance checking
    - Technology: Technical accuracy validation
```

### Batch Processing Enhancement
- **Scalable Processing**: Handle 10,000+ concurrent requests
- **Smart Queuing**: Priority-based job scheduling
- **Export Capabilities**: Multiple format support (CSV, JSON, XLSX)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time batch job monitoring

## Phase 5: Frontend Feature Completion (Priority: Medium)
