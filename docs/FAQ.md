# ‚ùì AgentGuard Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Last Updated**: November 6, 2025

##  Getting Started

### What is AgentGuard?
AgentGuard is a production-grade AI safety platform that helps developers detect hallucinations, block prompt injections, and optimize AI costs. Think of it as a security layer for your AI agents.

### How does it work?
AgentGuard analyzes your AI's inputs and outputs in real-time using multiple detection methods:
1. **Multi-model consensus** - Multiple AI models vote on safety
2. **Semantic analysis** - Understanding context and meaning
3. **Pattern matching** - Detecting known attack patterns
4. **Uncertainty quantification** - Measuring AI confidence

### Do I need to change my existing code?
Minimal changes! For LangChain/LlamaIndex, just add our callback handler. For other frameworks, wrap your AI calls with our SDK. Most integrations take < 10 minutes.

### What languages/frameworks do you support?
- **SDKs**: Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI
- **APIs**: REST API for any language
- **Models**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, custom models

##  Pricing & Billing

### How much does AgentGuard cost?
- **Free**: 100 queries/month, perfect for testing
- **Pro**: $49/month for 10,000 queries
- **Business**: $299/month for 100,000 queries
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for unlimited scale

See full pricing at [agentguard.ai/pricing](https://agentguard.ai/pricing)

### What counts as a "query"?
One query = one safety check. If you check both user input and agent output, that's 2 queries. Streaming validation counts tokens, not messages.

### Can I save money with AgentGuard?
Yes! Semantic caching reduces redundant AI calls by 40-60%, often saving more than AgentGuard costs. Plus, catching hallucinations early prevents costly mistakes.

### What happens if I exceed my tier limit?
We'll send you a notification. On the free tier, requests are rate-limited. On paid tiers, we'll continue service and bill overage at $0.005/query.

### Can I upgrade/downgrade anytime?
Yes! Upgrade instantly. Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle. No long-term contracts required.

##  Security & Privacy

### Is my data secure?
Absolutely. We use:
- **TLS 1.3** encryption for all data in transit
- **AES-256** encryption for data at rest
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance (in progress)
- **GDPR** compliant
- **Regular security audits** (95/100 security score)

### Do you store my AI prompts/responses?
We store metadata (timestamps, safety scores) for 30 days. Full prompt/response text is optional and encrypted. You control retention policies.

### Can I self-host AgentGuard?
Enterprise plans include on-premise deployment options. Contact sales@agentguard.ai for details.

### What about compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)?
- **GDPR**: Fully compliant
- **SOC 2**: Certification in progress (Q1 2026)
- **HIPAA**: Available for Enterprise plans
- **ISO 27001**: Planned for Q2 2026

##  Features & Capabilities

### What is hallucination detection?
Hallucination detection identifies when AI models generate false or fabricated information. AgentGuard uses multi-model consensus to achieve 95%+ accuracy.

### What is prompt injection protection?
Prompt injection is when users try to manipulate your AI with malicious prompts. AgentGuard blocks these attacks before they reach your model.

### What is semantic caching?
Instead of exact-match caching, semantic caching finds similar prompts using embeddings. This catches 40-60% more cache hits, dramatically reducing API costs.

### What is streaming validation?
For streaming responses (like ChatGPT), AgentGuard validates each token in real-time, flagging issues as they happen instead of waiting for the full response.

### Can I customize detection thresholds?
Yes! Adjust sensitivity for your use case:
- **High sensitivity**: Catch more issues, more false positives
- **Balanced**: Default setting (recommended)
- **Low sensitivity**: Fewer false positives, might miss edge cases

### Do you support webhooks?
Yes! Get real-time alerts in Slack, Teams, email, or custom endpoints when safety issues are detected.

##  Technical Questions

### What's the API latency?
AgentGuard adds <100ms latency. With caching enabled, responses are often faster than direct API calls.

### What's your uptime SLA?
- **Free**: Best effort (typically 99.5%+)
- **Pro**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Business**: 99.95% uptime SLA
- **Enterprise**: 99.99% uptime SLA with dedicated infrastructure

### How do I handle rate limits?
Each tier has rate limits:
- **Free**: 10 requests/minute
- **Pro**: 100 requests/minute
- **Business**: 1000 requests/minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Use our SDK's built-in retry logic or implement exponential backoff.

### Can I use AgentGuard with multiple AI models?
Yes! AgentGuard works with any LLM:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Cohere
- Hugging Face models
- Custom/local models

### What about batch processing?
Yes! Use our batch API to process multiple prompts efficiently. Great for testing, evaluation, and offline analysis.

### Can I test AgentGuard locally?
Yes! Use our test mode with mock responses, or run against our staging environment. No credit card required for testing.
