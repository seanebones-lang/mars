- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, monitoring, whitelisting
- **Contingency**: Adjust limits, add bypass mechanism

**3. Payment Processing**
- **Risk**: Stripe integration issues
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, sandbox environment
- **Contingency**: Manual invoicing, delay paid features

**4. Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: Data breach, API abuse

- **Contingency**: Incident response plan, security team

**5. Infrastructure Scaling**
- **Risk**: Traffic spike crashes system
- **Mitigation**: Auto-scaling, load testing, CDN
- **Contingency**: Upgrade instance, add servers
